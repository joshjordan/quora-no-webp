quora-no-webp
==============

A simple Chrome plugin that reloads images on Quora without WebP conversion. Why? For me, its because I clip Quora articles to Evernote, and Evernote doesn't render WebP images inline.

Yeah, this is a very specific purpose. No, I don't expect anyone else to find value in it.
